As [some have already noticed](https://hachyderm.io/@Markus@social.linux.pizza/113132336874320907), when we announced in the last post that we moved ziglang.org
off the cloud, we also moved the website from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to [Zine](https://zine-ssg.io), a static site generator written in Zig by yours truly (with the help
of a few very kind contributors).

While most of the speed improvement comes from having an overall saner deployment
architecture, Zine does play a role simply by properly leveraging the Zig cache
system to avoid re-generating pages that have not changed.

That said, this is not the main benefit of switching to Zine. As somebody who
has spent a bunch of time working on this website, my favorite change is how
content that has complex layouting needs has turned out. You can read more on 
this general topic [here](https://zine-ssg.io/docs/supermd/) (see the 
'two columns' example).

That, and the fact that [now I can get build errors when I write wrong HTML](https://kristoff.it/blog/first-html-lsp/).

## Introducing the Zig Devlog

Over time many have asked where to go to get updates about the Zig project between
releases. While the best answer to that question was, and still is, to look at
the git commit log :^), we now have a "devlog", a curated list of updates from
the core team about recent changes to Zig.

[https://ziglang.org/devlog/](https://ziglang.org/devlog/)

I've also written a blog post to encourage Zig community members to create similar
setups their Zig projects, in order to start creating resilient communication channels
between communities scattered across different social platforms.

You can read more in [Critical Social Infrastructure for Zig Communities](https://kristoff.it/blog/critical-social-infrastructure/).

Kind regards,  
Loris
