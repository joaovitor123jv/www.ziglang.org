As part of our [Donor Bounty Program](/news/announcing-donor-bounties/), a new 
bounty has been confirmed with an anonymous donor.

## Criteria

Implement [labeled continue syntax inside a switch 
expression](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/8220) according to 
Andrew's specifications outlined in the issue, and along with any 
follow-up clarifications.

It doesn't matter who implements it, or whether multiple people work together
on implementing it, or how much help is needed from the core Zig team. As long
as it gets done properly and the donor is satisfied with the results, the
bounty will be awarded.

## Reward

The anonymous donor has offered 4,000 USD to be donated to Zig Software 
Foundation if the criteria can be met by **April 30, 2024**.

Good luck!
