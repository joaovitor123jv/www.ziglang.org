I am pleased to announce our newest Zig team member,
[Matthew Lugg](https://mlugg.co.uk/).

This announcement is long overdue. Matthew started contributing in the
beginning of 2023. He did not waste any time getting his hands dirty -
immediately tackling core issues facing the compiler's frontend, including the
command-line interface, first pass lowering ("AstGen"), and Semantic Analysis phase.

Matthew has a key competency of a Zig core team member: although he shares the
same overall vision of the project, he forms his own opinions about how things
should work by doing his own reasoning from scratch, and then - importantly -
puts the communication legwork in to share those findings with the rest of the
team and takes the time to bring everyone into alignment.

On top of this, Matthew exercises patience, grace, and kindness when
interacting with Zig community members. These skills are mandatory for someone
who will potentially speak for and represent the Zig project. Not only does
Matthew pass with flying colors, he sets an example for the rest of the team,
including myself, to follow.

Speaking for the Zig Software Foundation, we are eager to offer Matthew a
contract as soon as funds allow.

In any case, please give Matthew a warm welcome to the team.

-Andrew
