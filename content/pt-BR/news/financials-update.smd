The Zig Software Foundation keeps public record of its financial status. In the past few months we accumulated some "bureaucratic" debt, as we failed to keep the public record up to date. We have recently gained a new internal tracking system that allows us to publish this information with less manual work, so we've backfilled the transaction history for 2021. We will also aim to publish updates on a monthly cadence from now on.

Being aware of the financials behind the operations of a non-profit foundaton can give you invaluable insight that you would not be able to get otherwise, [so we warmly recommend you take a look at the newly published data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_ljFHGFXY5NhBhlfjgkO0RZHqeVv04fAmCxw3ZusYc/edit#gid=99104331).

Kind regards,
