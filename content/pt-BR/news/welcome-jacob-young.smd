I am pleased to announce our newest Zig team member, Jacob Young
(screenname: [jacobly0](https://github.com/jacobly0)).

Jacob has already contributed significant, valuable improvements to various
parts of the Zig project, including the C backend, x86 backend,
frontend, and countless bug fixes. He played a central role in helping us
[eliminate our C++ bootstrap compiler](/news/goodbye-cpp/) and is already playing
a similar role for our [reliance on LLVM](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/16270).
He is a truly formidable contributor who gets to the bottom of things and is not afraid to
[diagnose and report Linux kernel bugs](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/16297),
or
[land patches directly in Clang](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/60465).

Additionally, Jacob has proven to be a steadfast community leader,
setting an example for how to treat others with kindness and respect.
I've watched him be consistently patient with newbies, helping mentor their
contributions to areas of code that he maintains. I've also noticed him eager to unblock
fellow contributors, setting others up for success by eliminating the difficulties they face.

Jacob is now able to bill hours to the [Zig Software Foundation](/zsf/). It is thanks to
recurring donations from our many sponsors that we can offer this. If your employer offers
charity donation matching, please consider choosing ZSF, a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

Most importantly, please give Jacob a warm welcome to the core Zig team.

-Andrew
