Over here at the Zig Software Foundation, we're following the latest trends. We
know what's important to you all - watching the **line go up**.

That's why part of our culture here is making sure the line goes up no matter
what, so that all zero of our investors can get outsized return on their
nonexistent investments.

So that's why we have brought you a new mascot to join the party!

She comes to us via community member Xeonracer, who learned how to make SVGs in
order to bring her to life.

Introducing **Carmen the Allocgator**!

In summary, go ahead and adapt her to whatever suits your purposes, just don't
pretend that you are the Zig Software Foundation, or that you created the
original work of art.

See ya later, allocgator ;-)
